 \title{Powers of $2$ versus powers of $3$: some thoughts about the battle}
 \author{Charlot Colmes}
 \maketitle 


 The aim of this paper is to prove the following two theorems, which deal with powers of $2$ and $3$:

   \begin{theorem}[Herschfeld $1936$] \label{thm:2m-moins-3n}
     For all $m$, $n \in \bN$,
     $- 139 < 2^m - 3^n  < 269$ implies both $m \le 8$ and $n \le 5$.
   \end{theorem}

   
   \begin{theorem}[$1992$ Indian Mathematical Olympiad]  \label{thm:IndMO}
     For all $x$, $m$, $n \in \bN$,
     $x^2 = 2^m + 3^n$ is equivalent to
     $$
     (x, 2^m, 3^n) \in \{  (5, 16, 9), (3, 8, 1), (2, 1, 3) \} \, .
     $$
   \end{theorem}

  
   Theorem~\ref{thm:2m-moins-3n}
   was stated by Herschfeld in 1936 \cite{Herschfeld36, Ribenboim-Catalan} but his proof was never published.
   Theorem~\ref{thm:2m-moins-3n} is related to the famous \emph{Catalan's conjecture} \cite{Ribenboim-Catalan}.
   Since $2^{11} - 3^7 = - 139$ and $2^9 - 3^5 = 269$,
   Theorem~\ref{thm:2m-moins-3n} is optimal.
   Theorem~\ref{thm:IndMO} solves Question~$8$ of the $1992$ Indian Mathematical Olympiad.
   Our proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:2m-moins-3n} relies on a ``magic'' modulus and requires the assistance of a computer;
   we show that such a method is not applicable to Theorem~\ref{thm:IndMO}.

   \begin{lemma} \label{lem:powers-congruent}
     Let $i$, $j$, $k$, $x \in \bZ$ be such that $0 \le i < j$ and $i \le k$.
     There exists $l \in [i, j - 1]$ such that 
     $x^k$ is congruent to  $x^l$ modulo $x^j - x^i$. 
     %$x^{i + k}$ is congruent to $x^{i + k \bmod (j - i)}$ modulo $x^j - x^i$. 
   \end{lemma}

   \begin{proof}
     Put $m = x^j - x^i$.
     We proceed by induction on~$k$.
     If $k \in [i, j - 1]$ then $k$ is a suitable choice for~$l$.
     Therefore, the first $j - i$ steps of our induction are cleared.
     Now, assume $k \ge j$. %or equivalently, $k - j \in \bN$.
     Then, 
     the induction hypothesis ensures that there exists $l \in [i, j - 1]$ such that
     $x^{i - j + k}$ is congruent to $x^l$ modulo~$m$.
     Therefore, $m$ divides 
     $$
     % = (x^k - x^{i - j + k}) + (x^{i - j + k} - x^l)
     m x^{k - j} + \left(x^{i - j + k} - x^l \right) =  x^k - x^l \,, 
   $$
   and thus $x^k$ is congruent to $x^l$ modulo~$m$.
     % Besides, $x^k$ is congruent to $x^{i - j + k}$  modulo $m$ because 
     % $x^k - x^{i - j + k} = m x^{k - j}$.
  %   It follows that $x^k$ is congruent to $x^l$ modulo $m$ by transitivity.
     \end{proof}
   
   Let $x \in \bZ$ and let $m \in \bZast$.
   The sequence $\left( x^n \bmod m \right)_{n \in \bN}$ is eventually periodic.
   It is purely periodic if, and only if, $x$ is coprime to~$m$.
   Euler's theorem ..
   
   \begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:2m-moins-3n}]
     For all $m$, $n \in \bN$ such that $- 139 < 2^m - 3^n < 269$, $m \le 8$ is equivalent to $n \le 5$.
     %because $269 + 3^5 = 2^9$ and $139 + 2^8 < 729 = 3^6$.
     Therefore, it suffices to prove that there exists $q \in \bNast$
     such that
     $$
\left( 2^{m + 9} - 3^n \right) \bmod q  \in [269, q - 139]  
     $$
     for all $m$, $n \in \bN$. 
     Set $q = 2^9 \cdot 17 \cdot 257 = 2236928$.
     Put
     % $$
     % P_2  = \left\{ 2^m \bmod q : m \in [9, 24] \right\}
     % $$
     % and
     % $$
     % P_3  = \left\{ 3^n \bmod q : n \in [0, 255] \right\} \,.
     % $$
     \begin{align*}
     P_2 & = \left\{ 2^m \bmod q : m \in [9, 24] \right\} 
               \intertext{and}
     P_3 & = \left\{ 3^n \bmod q : n \in [0, 255] \right\} \,.
      \end{align*}
     For each $k  \in \bN$,
     Lemma~\ref{lem:powers-congruent} ensures that
     at least one element of $P_2$ is congruent to $2^{k + 9}$  modulo $2^{24} - 2^9$
     and that
     at least one element of $P_3$ is congruent to $3^k$ modulo $3^{256} - 1$.
     A very basic laptop computer checks instantly that $q$ divides both $2^{25} - 2^9$ and $3^{256}  - 1$
     (after all, $3^{256}$ is only $406$ bit long).
     Therefore, for every $m$, $n \in \bN$ and every $r \in [-138, 268]$,
     at least one element of $Q$ is congruent to $2^m - 3^n - r$ modulo~$q$.
     Besides,
     our computer can also enumerate $Q$ in a matter of seconds and check that it does not contain any multiple of~$q$.
   \end{proof}

   \end{python}
   % A well-known Theorem~\ref{thm:2m-moins-3n}
   
   Let us now turn to the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:IndMO}.
   It requires the following two lemmas:

     \begin{lemma} \label{lem:x2=q+1}
       For every $x \in \bN$, $x^2 - 1$ is a prime power if, and only if, $x \in \{ 2, 3 \}$. 
     \end{lemma}

     \begin{proof}
       The ``if'' part is easily checked: $2^2 - 1 = 3^1$ and $3^2 - 1 = 2^3$. 
       It remains to prove the ``only if'' part.
       Let $x$, $p \in \bN$ be such that $p$ is prime and $x^2 - 1$ is a power of~$p$.
       Since  $x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)$, 
       both $x - 1$ and $x + 1$ can be written as powers of~$p$.
       Besides, $x - 1$ is less than $x + 1$.
       Therefore, $x - 1$ divides $x + 1$.
       It follows that $x - 1$ divides $(x + 1) - (x - 1) = 2$,
       whence $x \in \{ 2, 3 \}$.
    \end{proof} 
    

   
   \begin{lemma} \label{lem:2m+3n-square-mod-12}
     For every $m$, $n \in \bNast$ such that $2^m + 3^n$ is a square modulo $12$,
     both $m$ and $n$ are even.
   \end{lemma}

   \begin{proof}
     Let $m$, $n \in \bNast$ be such that $2^m + 3^n$ is a square modulo $12$.
     In particular, $2^m + 3^n$ is both a square modulo $3$ and a square modulo~$4$.
     Since $2^m + 3^n$ is congruent to ${(- 1)}^m$ modulo $3$ and since $- 1$ is not a square modulo $3$,
     $m$ is even.
     In particular, $m$ is not less than $2$, and thus $2^m + 3^n$ is congruent to ${(- 1)}^n$ modulo~$4$.
     Besides, $- 1$ is not a square modulo~$4$.
     Therefore, $n$ is even.
   \end{proof}


   
   \begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:IndMO}]
     Assume $x^2 = 2^m + 3^n$.
     In the case where $m = 0$,
     we have $x^2 - 1 = 3^n$,
     and thus Lemma~\ref{lem:x2=q+1} ensures $x = 2$ and $n = 1$;
     in the case where $n = 0$,
     we have $x^2 - 1 = 2^m$,
     and thus Lemma~\ref{lem:x2=q+1} ensures $x = m = 3$.
     Let us now assume $mn \ne 0$.
     Then, Lemma~\ref{lem:2m+3n-square-mod-12} ensures that both $m$ and $n$ are even.
     In particular, both $\mu = m \binover 2$ and $\nu = n \binover 2$ are positive integers.
     Since 
     $$
     3^n = x^2 - 2^m = x^2 - 2^{2\mu} = (x - 2^\mu)(x + 2^\mu) \,, 
     $$
     there exists $k \in [0, n]$ such that $3^k = x - 2^\mu$ and $3^{n - k} = x + 2^\mu$.
     Besides, inequality $x - 2^\mu < x + 2^\mu$ is clear. 
     It follows $k < n - k$, or equivalently, $3^{n - 2 k} - 1 \in \bNast$.
     Subsequently, straightforward computations yield
     $$
     2^{\mu + 1} = (x + 2^\mu) - (x - 2^\mu) = 3^{n - k} - 3^k = 3^k \left( 3^{n - 2k} - 1 \right) \,,
     $$
     whence $k = 0$ and $2^{\mu + 1} = 3^n - 1$.
     Lemma~\ref{lem:x2=q+1} ensures $3^\nu \in \{ 2, 3 \}$.
     It follows $\nu = 1$, $n = 2$, $\mu = 2$, $m = 4$, and $x = 5$.
     The desired result is now easily checked by inspection. 
  \end{proof}

  Let us now show that 
  the magic moduli method cannot directly yield a proof for Theorem~\ref{thm:IndMO}.
  For each $Q \subseteq \bNast$,
  let $E_Q$ denote the set of those $(m, n) \in \bN \times \bN$ such that for every $q \in Q$,
  $2^m + 3^n$ is a square modulo~$q$.
  If we could finite a finite $Q \subseteq \bNast$ such that $E_G$ is finite
  then the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:IndMO} would reduce to an inspection of $E_Q$.
  The following theorem rules out the existence of such a $Q$:
  % they ensure that for every finite $Q \subseteq \bNast$,
  % both $E_Q \cap ( \{ 0 \} \times \bN )$ and $E_Q \cap ( \bN \times \{ 0 \})$ are infinite.

  \begin{lemma} \label{lem:square-mn-m-n}
   For every $p$, $q$, $x \in \bN$ such that $p$ and $q$ are coprime,
   $x$ is a square modulo $p q$
   if, and only if, $x$ is both a square modulo $p$ and a square modulo~$q$.
 \end{lemma}

 \begin{proof}
   The ``only if'' part is trivial
   (it was implicitly  used in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:2m+3n-square-mod-12} with $p = 3$ and $q = 4$).
   The ``if'' part follows from the Chinese remainder theorem.
 \end{proof} 

  Let $\phi$ denote Euler's totient function.

  \begin{lemma} \label{lem:Euler-0-or-1}
    Let $n$, $q \in \bNast$ be such that $q$ is a prime power that divides~$n$.
     For every $x \in \bN$, either $x^{\phi(n)}$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $q$ or $q$ divides $x^{\phi(n)}$.
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
    Let $p$, $r \in \bNast$ be such that $p$ is prime and $q = p^r$.
    Without loss of generality,
    we may assume that $p^{r + 1}$ does not divide $n$,
    whence $n q^{-1}$ and $q$ are coprime.
    First, assume that $p$ does not divide~$x$.
    Then, $x$ and $q$ are coprime,
    and thus Euler's theorem ensures that $x^{\phi(q)}$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $q$.
    Besides, $\phi(q)$ divides $\phi(n)$ because $\phi$ is multiplicative.
    It follows that $x^{\phi(n)}$ is a power of $x^{\phi(q)}$,
      and thus $x^{\phi(n)}$ is congruent to $1$ modulo~$q$.
    Second, assume that $p$ divides~$x$.
    Then, $q$ divides $x^r$.
    Besides, $x^r$ divides $x^{\phi(n)}$ because
    $$
    \phi(n) \ge \phi(q) = p^{r - 1} (p - 1) \ge 2^{r - 1} \ge r \,.
    $$
    It follows that $q$ divides $x^{\phi(n)}$.
\end{proof} 

An interesting corollary of Lemma~\ref{lem:Euler-0-or-1} is that 
for every $n$, $k \in \bNast$ and every $x \in \bN$,
$x^{\phi(n)}$ and $x^{k \phi(n)}$ are congruent modulo~$n$.
The latter result is a nice equivalent of Euler's theorem.

% \begin{proof}
%   Since $0 = 0^k$ and $1 = 1^k$,
%   Lemma~\ref{lem:Euler-0-or-1} ensures that 
%   $x^{\phi(n)}$ and $x^{k \phi(n)}$ are congruent modulo any prime power that divides~$n$.
% \end{proof}


   \begin{theorem}
    For every $(x, y) \in \{ (16, 9), (8, 1), (1, 3) \}$ and every $n$, $k \in \bNast$, 
    $x^{1 + k \phi(n)} + y^{1 + k \phi(n)}$ is a square modulo~$n$. 
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{proof}
    Put $m = 1 + k \phi(n)$.
    Let $q$ be a prime power that divides~$n$.
    % By Lemma~\ref{lem:square-mn-m-n}
    % Our task is to prove that $x^m + y^m$ is a square modulo~$q$.
    For each $u \in \bN$, 
    Lemma~\ref{lem:Euler-0-or-1} ensures that either $u^m$ is congruent to $u$ modulo $q$ or $q$ divides $u^m$.
    Therefore, 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $16^m + 9^m$ is congruent to $0$, $9$, $16$, or $25$ modulo $q$
      (although $0$ can be omitted from that list, its presence is harmless),
      \item $8^m + 1$ is congruent to $1$ or $9$ modulo $q$, and 
      \item $1 + 3^m$ is congruent to $1$ or $4$ modulo~$q$.
      \end{itemize}
      Since $0$, $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, and $25$ are perfect squares,
      $x^m + y^m$ is a square modulo~$q$.
      Since $q$ is any prime power that divides $n$,
      repeated applications of Lemma~\ref{lem:square-mn-m-n}
      show that $x^m + y^m$ is a square modulo~$n$.
    \end{proof}
